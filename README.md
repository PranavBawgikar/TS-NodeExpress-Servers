This GitHub repository contains a backend development project that leverages Node.js and TypeScript to build a robust and efficient server. The project explores various technologies and tools in the backend development realm to create a seamless API.

## Technologies Used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): A powerful runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enabling better tooling and improved code quality.
- [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) & [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/): Automatic server startup tools, enhancing development productivity.
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): API testing tools used to validate the backend API endpoints.

## TypeScript Compiler (tsc)

To ensure TypeScript code is successfully compiled, make sure you have TypeScript installed. Check the TypeScript version using the following command:

```
tsc --version
```

## Setting Up the Environment

To get started, install the necessary dependencies for the project:

```
npm install -g ts-node
npm install -g nodemon
npm install @types/node express @types/express
```

## API Development and Middleware

Study [Express.js Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html) and [bcrypt.genSalt()](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt#genSalt) function to enrich your understanding of developing APIs and enhancing application security.

## Testing the Backend API

For testing the backend API endpoints, we recommend using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), which provides a user-friendly environment to design, test, and explore APIs. Additionally, you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing and validation.

Start building, designing, and testing better APIs through spec-first development, driven by an APIOps CI/CD pipeline.

Explore the world of backend development with Node.js and TypeScript, and take your coding skills to the next level. Happy coding!
